WiFi may be the most asked for service by travellers. I'm definitely one
of them. I search through Tripadvisor reviews for the words WiFi and
internet. And leave screenshots of speedtest.net in Google Maps reviews
to inform others. But like all free things, free WiFi may come at a
cost. This is my first post in, what I intend to be, a series of
super-negative warning posts about technology. But to balance it, I'll
put some tips to keep yourself safe a the end.

### **WiFi without a password**
WiFi networks without a password are the worst. I agree that they are
convient and you see them everywhere. But you should never ever use
them. Here is why: if you connect to any WiFi network your
phone or laptop will remember the name and will reconnect to it when it
sees it again. It will keep searching for all the networks it knows when
it's not connected to a network.

Attackers can scan for the networks your phone is looking for or guess
what the common ones in the area are. That makes it easy for them to setup a
network without a password that your phone will connect to. You can try
it yourself, setup an old WiFi router and call the network "linksys" or
"wifi-in-de-trein" or "StarBucks Free WiFi" and watch your and other
peoples devices connect to it.

### **Why that's a problem**
You may wonder why it's such a big problem if your phone or laptop
connects to a fake network. The two main reasons are that an attacker can
manipulate or intercept what your are doing online.

### **Just any password is enough**
Your phone searches for WiFi networks that have a password too. And
attackers can see these searches too. That's not a problem because they
don't know the password and can't setup a network with the same name and
password to trick your device into connecting. Even a simple password is
soo much better than nothing.


### **So what can you do about it?**
The best thing is to never use WiFi networks without a password. And if
you did remove them afterwards from the list. On iOS this has to be done
while you are still connected. The button is a bit hidden and it's
called "forget network". On Android you can also deselect the "Auto
reconnect" option. That way you have to manually connect to the network
again if you want to use it again.

While using an unsecured wireless network it's best to encrypt your
traffic with a VPN. I'll dive deeper into VPN's in another post.
